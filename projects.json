The collection and analysis of these intricate, decorative designs was done by the use of contemporary methods and techniques. Photography was used as the primary method of data collection, whilst vector illustrations were used to enhance or visualise better a particular design. All the gathered data was then collected and presented in a one single printed publication.",

Through an intimate exploration of the subject's great grandmother's journey, the thesis captures the beauty and complexities of solitude in the face of loss. Over the span of six months, the photographer has documented the emotional highs and lows of this transition, revealing the intricacies of the human experience in times of great challenge. Through a series of compelling images, this thesis provides a powerful and thought-provoking reflection on the meaning and value of solitude in times of grief.",

Therefore, Miguel created this 3D board game in order to put the players (humans) in the shoes of Dolphins in captivity, used and restricted to live as humans want them too. This dissertation wants to install a level of empathy towards these Dolphins.

Her project also focuses on text and illustrations that work together to convey her thoughts and experiences to the reader. Through the course of her project, she aimed to highlight the thought process and misconceptions of ADHD as well as to promote a more personal and in depth understanding of the disorder.",

The deadpan portraits as well as the ethnographic observations of the researcher before, during, and after the photography sessions are systematically analysed through engagement with the theories of non-verbal communication, body language, and personality traits.",

By studying the connections between these art forms, through various themes, a multi-sensory experience is created. This is done through experimental work, where a curated playlist, that features, Indie music is translated into a visual journey. The project aims to prioritise the user's experience when it comes to listening to music. Due to the introduction of visuals, the audience is more immersed in the subject, where they are invited to use more senses and get a better understanding of the music provided.",

The creation of the world was driven by experimenting with Surrealist techniques on psychic automatism. These served as an exploration of the unconscious mind and lead me to explore the contradictions between public and self, conscious and unconscious. The animation was created by implementing and taking advantage of both 3D and 2D software/techniques, in order to facilitate and enhance the production workflow.",

Rachel explores how other artists translate their own memories, feelings, and experiences into visually stunning works of art. Digital illustrations emerge from her practice as research, which she then transforms into illustrative embroidered works. Combining the digital and the traditional, each minimalistic and allusive illustration is carefully embroidered onto found fabric, culminating in an installation that ultimately aims to evoke personal memories, experiences, and emotions in every viewer.",

He has been working with mixed media, graphic design, digital illustration and sculpting as a way to expand his artistic portfolio, and to gain a holistic approach to his creative process. This led him to consider Virtual Reality as a medium for his dissertation. This dissertation is an exploration of the use of empty space and rhythm within 3-dimensional, immersive environments, and of how these elements affect the visualisation of an artwork in a virtual exhibition. Through the use of Minimalist design elements, 3D animation and sound design, 3 different virtual environments were created to illustrate the impact of space and movement in Virtual Reality.",

The shadow archetype can be defined as the parts of the self that are hidden and difficult to face, and are therefore generally avoided by the self. Virtual Reality is used as a medium to encourage confrontation with this part of the self in a space that is absolutely private and isolated.",
